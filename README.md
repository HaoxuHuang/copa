## Get Started
Install SoM following the [instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/SoM#rocket-quick-start).  
Install [graspnetAPI](https://github.com/graspnet/graspnetAPI).  
Download examples and place it under the data directory.  
Run the demo
```console
$ python demo.py
```

## Real-World Deployment
Please follow the instruction in `real_world/README.md`.

## Acknowledgement
- Our grounding module is adapted from [SoM](https://github.com/microsoft/SoM).
- We use [GraspNet](https://graspnet.net/) for grasp candidates generation.
